Tale a few minutes today to appreciate your life, and be grateful for plants, friends, partner, nature, family or pets. Just think what a luxury it is to be surrounded by such warm and beautiful presences!"

Seek shelter in the woods and look for big trees and funny-looking bugs. In the winter, go ice-skating at an outdoor rink or build the biggest snowman possible. Fresh air is an amazing remedy for feeling gloomy."

One step toward being more focused in our everyday lives is to try and do one thing at a time. For today, try small: leave your phone in another room when working or studying, and try to time your tasks so you only focus on one thing for, say, 15 minutes."

What we want you to do today is break down each task into many small tasks! For example, if you need to clean the apartment today, write tasks like 'Make the bed', 'Dust the bookshelf' and 'Wipe the kitchen counter'. Breaking it down into small tasks will first of all give you a greater feeling of accomplishment, plus the visual cue of having so many items ticked off your list."

Based on these reflections, think about what you can do tomorrow to achieve your goals."

Instead, try to listen to your body. When do you actually feel tired? Go to bed at that time, even though you have 30 minutes left on the tv series episode. Listen to what your body needs - it is probably more sleep, so give it that. Sleep depravation is the ultimate focus killer!"

With every bite, think about the flavors, textures and sensations you experience. Chew with purpose, and focus on the taste of the meal. Can you identify all the flavor types: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami? Eat slowly, and listen to your body when it feels full."
